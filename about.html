			<p>The idea of Willow Bakery was partly inspired by my love of sweets and pastries, but mostly inspired by my dog, Willow. She is not allowed human treats, but I'm sure if she was she would devour them all in an instant. Devour may actually be too aggressive of a term, because in actuality she is a complete sweetheart and would very hesitantly accept a treat, to the point where you will get impatient and exclaim, "just take it already"! But after finally realizing she is in fact allowed to have the treat she would snatch it and run away to either enjoy it in private or to hide it somewhere safe for later. As for me, I would most definitely devour these fictional treats in an instant and then be sad that I did not savor them. </p>
